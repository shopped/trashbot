# Machine Learning Model notes on Habana Gaudi

git clone -b 1.3.0 https://github.com/HabanaAI/Model-References.git

cat labels.txt | awk '{PRINT $2}' > /data/train/synset_labels.txt

change TensorFlow/computer_vision/common/imagenet_preprocessing.py

NUM_CLASSES
NUM_IMAGES
_NUM_TRAIN_FILES
_SHUFFLE_BUFFER

Modify last layer into layers.dense(1001)
Add layers.Dense(num_classes)
num_classes are 2 but 3, imagenet has a noise class this would be helpful
Check your architecture with...
tf.keras.models.load_model(saved_model.pb)
model.summary('.')

resnet50 model
wget https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1?tf-hub-format=compressed
tar xzf

tiny imagenet is 32x32 200 classes
wget http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip

# Misc Software/Data Notes

do not have a requirements.txt, can/will update when i run another instance
not sure if c++ build can be cross platform so make sure you run cmake --build . on checkout
perhaps integrate with TOCO, not classification they have segmentation maps and a tool/automated collection pipeline...
but they are open source and you can 10x their data with what you already built (they only have a few hundred images)

# Misc Hardware Notes

Biggest flaw is the size, should be bigger for bigger trash items
I would also have to empty it less often with a bigger container
No gaps for smaller trash and so it can be waterproof / dirt resistant
The Claw Sensor get unaligned sometimes but is a great feature, a tighter mate would make it a joy to use
To take it outside, an IMU to detect falls and speaker to announce when lost are easy wins
You spent a lot of time before realizing that SPI Neopixel communication only works on a certain GPIO port
Never build on top of an oddly shaped thing again...
